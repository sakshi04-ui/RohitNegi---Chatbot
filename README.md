# 🧠 AI Mentor just like our Rohit Bhaiya — Hackathon Project 

**Live Demo:**[https://rohitnegi-chatbott.netlify.app/](https://rohitnegi-chatbott.netlify.app/)

An innovative AI mentor chatbot that simulates **human-like behavior** using prompt engineering. The bot takes on the persona of **Rohit Bhaiya**, a mentor figure who guides users like a trusted elder brother, helping them in coding, interview prep, and concept clarity — all through natural, human-like conversations.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores the **behavioral pattern of humans** applied in a chatbot. By carefully designing prompts and descriptions, the AI acts like **Rohit Bhaiya**, a senior mentor character who:

* explains concepts simply,
* motivates and guides users,
* helps debug code,
* prepares learners for interviews,
* and creates a comfortable chat environment like an elder sibling would.

The project was built **solo** using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
